		<h2><u>Opening and Launch:</u></h2>
			<p>
				Communicate the opening of your store a few weeks before to capture attention and generate some expectation in your area.
				You only have to invite everyone to your premises one day and at a specific time.There are a few options for the type of fruit market you might open.
				Costs will vary accordingly, but should be relatively inexpensive to get started. If you set up a roadside stand, your overhead costs will involve the construction of the fruit bins, a temporary structure to cover your produce
				from the elements and the fruits you are selling. 
			</p>
		<h2><i>Schedule:</i></h2>
			<p>
				 It's essential to hang it near the entrance and the cash register.
			</p>
		<h2>Home delivery and online orders:</h2>
			<p>
				It's increasingly common to offer this service for people who buy at the store and receive the parcel at home, and for those  order <del>ofline</del> <ins>online</ins>.
				 you will find many templates for home delivery.A majority of your operating costs will reflect the cost to stock your shelves and bins. If you are buying your fruits from farms and wholesalers, your overhead will be the market costs.
				 If you are selling your own fruits from your farm and/or orchard, your costs will also reflect the money spent cultivating and growing your products.
			</p>
		<h2><mark>Health benefits:</mark></h2>
			<p>
				You are selling health, so take advantage of this by using a simple quote or by specifying the details of each fruit or vegetable.Fruits are an excellent source of essential vitamins and minerals, and they are high in fiber. Fruits also provide a wide range of health-boosting antioxidants, including flavonoids.
				Eating a diet high in fruits and vegetables can reduce a person's risk of developing heart disease, cancer, inflammation, and diabetes.
			</p>
		<h2>Offers and promotions:</h2>
			<p>
				Although they are usual, using an innovative template to communicate them be more attractive.The product to be promoted is fresh fruit juice, extracted directly from fresh fruits through a blender. It can be taken either as a mixture of different fresh fruits extracts or from a single fruit. Different fruits have got different flavours, for example, mango, orange, pineapple, apple, water melon, peach and so on.
				A mixture of different flavours is normally referred to as juice cocktail.
			</p>
		<h2>Price:</h2>
			<p>
				It's time to modernize those posters written with a marker. With a simple design, the offers and regular prices will be more eye-catching.Fruit and vegetable cost does impact availability and has the greatest impact for high-cost items. Although cost was inversely related to availability, African Americans reported higher fruit and vegetable availability than Whites.
				Additional studies are needed to determine whether food items of lower nutritive value and comparable cost impact availability.
			</p>
		<h2>Seasonal,ecological and local products:</h2>
			<p>
				It's good to highlight the qualities of some products.
				Don't forget to mention if it's <b>organic and quality fruit</b> or its origin, since these data may convince an indecisive buyer.Many experts and doctors recommend eating seasonal fruits because they are high in nutrients. They are beneficial to health, but they also help to boost immunity and keep infections at bay.
				Another advantage is that you can get fresh fruits directly from your local stores rather than relying on packaged supermarket fruits that may be out of season.
